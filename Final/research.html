	<font color=darkred size=4px>SRIC: SPONSORED RESEARCH & INDUSTRIAL CONSULTANCY</font><br><br>
	
Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy are two important modes through which the faculty maintains contact with the frontiers of knowledge and the latest developments in technology. We have entered an era when the products and their technological contents are changing rapidly due to intense competition in the globalized market. Innovations and application of new knowledge have become the key to the survival of Industries. The life of a generation of product has been reduced to only a few years and is becoming increasingly shorter. In these times of continuous innovation and fast changing technology the curriculum must also be updated continuously to keep pace with time and research and consultancy projects help the faculty to enrich the curriculum on a regular basis to offer quality education in science and technology.<br>
