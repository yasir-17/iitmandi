		Nestled in the Sivalik Range of the Himalayas, away from the bustle of the metropolis, a new abode of learning has germinated. A few hours before the Himalayan resort Kullu in Himachal 		Pradesh, IIT Mandi has been established with the vision to be a leader in science and technology education, knowledge creation and innovation, in an India marching towards a just, 			inclusive and sustainable society.

		<center><img src="1.png"/></center>
		Theme: The freedom to learn from the limitless domain of knowledge and the freedom to be unique.<br>
		Composition: The suspension bridge of Mandi, an engineering marvel, is the focal point of the logo with the symbolic representation of hills, sun and the Beas.
		Meaning: Far from the maddening crowd, this bower of education is endowed with invigorating lush green surroundings. The sun rises on these mountains to spread the hue of true knowledge. 		The Beas, unaware of its own majesty, flows beneath an engineering marvel - a century old suspension bridge of the historical Mandi town.<br>
		Symbolism: Three colours are used in the logo, viz., blue, green and orange. Blue signifies limitless sky, thus symbolizes the vast expanse of knowledge. Green signifies vegetation, youth 		and freshness of ideas. Orange signifies energy and the spirit of dedication. The depth in the logo signifies unending quest for excellence. The bridge, which is a specimen of the cutting 		edge engineering skills of the yesteryears, portends similar wondrous creations by the students of IIT Mandi.
		<br><br>
		Thus, the logo depicts what IIT Mandi is - a youthful and a vibrant destination for the steadfast pursuit of knowledge and excellence!. The IIT Mandi logo has been designed by Dr. Ila 		Gupta, Associate Professor, Department of Architecture, IIT Roorkee.
